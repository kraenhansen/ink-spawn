## Features

- The `<Spawn />`
  - starts executing a child process as it mounts,
  - kills the process as it unmounts and prints,
  - renders a configurable status text (running, succeeded, failed),
  - renders the last lines below the status of a running process.
  - propagates terminal interrupts (users pressing Ctrl + C)
- The `<Script />`
  - Wraps `<Spawn />` and any other elements element.
  - Sequential mode (default): Renders only the subset of completed children and the currently running runnable (`<Spawn />` and other nested `<Script />`).
  - Parallel mode: Renders all children, making processes spawn in parallel.
  - Infinitely composable: Put parallel scripts, inside sequential scripts, inside ...
